# Differential-Privacy-with-supervised-Learning
#Creating Differentially Private supervised algorithms and testing the privacy and analysis properties of the algorithms with multiple dataset


#The great American engineer, statistician, Professor and the father of modern quality management, William Edwards Deming, once said “In God we trust; all others must bring data.” This seems to be the fundamental truth when we look at the current scientific applications and technologies which led us to believe that “ Data is the new oil”. However in this rapidly emerging data oriented paradigm, the problem of data privacy is slowly creeping in which is going to be the next big concern if not addressed immediately. The issue of privacy has primarily been a topic of interest in the field of cryptology and mostly ignored by the conventional statistical methodologies and data collection mechanisms. Few recent works led by Dwork et. al however have developed a new domain of data privacy in Statistics which we believe is still in its nascent state. The current work applies the concept of differential privacy for standard high dimensional regression methodologies.
